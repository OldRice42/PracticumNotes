      <div class="title-topic">Intro to Git</div>
      <div class="text_body">
        <p>You’re starting to get familiar with front-end development. Now it’s time for your first independent project. It'll look even more like the projects you’ll see in the real world. You’ll have to write a lot of HTML and CSS. We'll also get to know, bit by bit, the tools that web developers use daily. We'll focus on Git first. Before we take a look at it, let’s look at what it’s used for.</p>
        <p><b>Version Control</b></p>
        <p>Imagine that you’ve successfully created a website for a client. The website is running, and people are visiting it. The client asks you to redo part of the website’s functionality. They believe that it’ll make using the website easier. You make the changes, update everything, then leave it and forget it. A month later, the client writes to tell you that their assumption was wrong, and they want to revert the website back to its previous state. But you don’t have the previous version saved, so you have to write everything from scratch again.</p>
        <p>This wouldn’t happen if there were a way to save file versions from different times. You could just revert to the previous version without needing to redo anything. Imagine that the entire file history has been saved and that you can revert to code from the past:</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_a.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>Guess what? Git knows how to handle tasks like this. We can save different versions of the code as we write and rewrite it. That’s why Git is called a version control system.</p>
        <p><b>Teamwork</b></p>
        <p>You’ve been working on your project and tasks by yourself. In real life, however, you’ll be expected to write code as part of a team. Several people can work on one website.</p>
        <p>You could build it with a friend, for instance. Every time you add changes to the code, you could send your friend an updated archive. Then your friend could download it, put in some changes, and send it back to you. But then you decide to put in your changes before your friend sends back his version. After all, it’s quicker to work in parallel.</p>
        <p>The two of you end up sending each other archives with changes at the same time. How do you combine them? There are lots of changes, and neither one of you remembers exactly what you changed. You have to open your code on the left, your friend’s code on the right, and compare everything manually. Don't want to work that way? Don’t sweat it. Git will do it automatically.</p>
        <p><b>Summary</b></p>
        <p>The ability to save and merge team members' work makes Git an indispensable tool when working on code as a team. Most employers require you to know how to use it. That’s why we integrate it into projects from the get-go. This chapter is about Git.</p>

      <div class="title-topic">Installing Git</div>
      <div class="text_body">
        <p>You have to install Git, just as you would any other software. What you have to do varies from one operating system to another. Select your OS.</p>
        <p><b>Windows</b></p>
        <p>Download and install Git on your computer. <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/" target="_blank">Link to the download page on Git’s official website</a>.</p>
        <p>When you launch the installer, you’ll have the option to install Git Bash, too. This is another program that helps Git run correctly. Be sure to check the box to install it. Check “Use Git from the Command Prompt,” too. We’ll discuss this further in the next lesson.</p>
        <p><b>macOS</b></p>
        <p>Download and install Git on your computer. <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/" target="_blank">Link to the download page on Git’s official website</a>.</p>
        <p>It’s pretty simple, except for one thing. The installer will offer you several ways to use Git. Select “Use Git from the Command Prompt.” We’ll cover that in more detail in the next lesson.</p>
        <p><b>Linux</b></p>
        <p>Download and install Git on your computer. <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/" target="_blank">Link to the download page on Git’s official website</a>.</p>
        <p>Use the Terminal to install it. Search for the Terminal and select it from the list of programs. The Terminal lets you use only text commands to interact with the program. Search for the Install Git command for your version of Linux, paste it in the Terminal, and press Enter. Congratulations! You’ve installed Git.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card_body">
      <div class="title-topic">Command Line</div>
      <div class="text_body">
        <p>We’ve gotten used to software having graphical interfaces with buttons and drop-down menus with settings. The command line is also an interface. It just happens to be a text-based one. You have to enter commands to work with programs. For example, to create a folder, you usually right-click and select the option you need in the graphical menu. But you can also create a folder with the command prompt by entering the appropriate command and the folder name. It’s just a different kind of interface.</p>
        <p>Now let’s get down to business. To open the command prompt:</p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>On Windows, open GIt Bash.</li>
            <li>On macOS or Linux, open Terminal.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>We talked about creating a folder in our example, so let’s explore how to do that in the command prompt.</p>
        <p>In the command prompt, you’re always in a folder, too. You just can’t see it. The pwd command lets you find out where you currently are. PWD stands for print working directory. Enter pwd in the command prompt and press Enter:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>pwd</p>
          <p>/Users/students_yandex</p>
        </div>
        <p>The command prompt returns a response. It’s the path to the folder we’re in right now. You’ll see your username instead of <code class="text_code-inline">students_yandex</code>. This is the home directory, or the directory where the user stores their personal files. When you open the command prompt, this is where you start off.</p>
        <p>In a graphical interface, you see the open folder’s content. Use the <code class="text_code-inline">ls</code> command to do this in the command prompt. The command is used to list directory contents. If you type this command and press Enter, you’ll see the current directory’s contents: its files and folders.</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_b.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>So now we know where we are. We’ve had a look around, and now it’s time to learn how to move around. To go from one folder to another, use the <code class="text_code-inline">cd</code> command. This stands for <i>change directory</i>. The syntax for this command is <code class="text_code-inline">cd file_name</code>:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>cd Desktop # going to the desktop</p>
          <p>pwd</p>
          <p>/Users/students_yandex/Desktop # this is where we are now</p>
        </div>
        <p>If the folder name has spaces, use quotation marks:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>cd "Desk top"</p>
        </div>
        <p>To return to the parent directory—that is, one level higher—write two dots <code class="text_code-inline">..</code> instead of the folder name:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>cd .. # going one level higher</p>
          <p>pwd</p>
          <p>/Users/students_yandex # we're back
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Why two dots? Who knows?!</p>
        <p><b>Creating folders and files</b></p>
        <p>Now let’s do something. The <code class="text_code-inline">mkdir</code> command creates a folder. Assign the name of the new folder to the command.</p>
        <p>Create a folder called <code class="text_code-inline">dev</code> in the home directory.. This will be where you save your school projects:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>mkdir dev # will create the dev folder in the current directory</p>
        </div>
        <p>Go to the dev folder, create a folder called first-project inside it, and go to that folder:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>cd dev</p>
          <p>mkdir first-project</p>
          <p>cd first-project</p>
        </div>
        <p>Let’s create the files we need. We can do this with the touch command, assigning it the file name, for example:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>touch index.html # will create the index.html file in the current folder</p>
        </div>
        <p>Create the <code class="text_code-inline">style.css</code> file on your own.</p>
        <p>By the end of this lesson, your home directory should have the <code class="text_code-inline">dev</code> folder with the <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code> folder inside it and two files inside that, <code class="text_code-inline">index.html</code> and <code class="text_code-inline">style.css</code>.</p>
        <p><b>Deleting folders and files</b></p>
        <p>The last thing we’ll do is learn how to use the command prompt to delete files and folders. To delete files, use the <code class="text_code-inline">rm</code> command, which stands for <i>“remove”</i>:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>rm about.html # will delete about.html from the current folder</p>
        </div>
        <p>If, however, the folder you’re trying to delete has files in it, the command prompt won’t delete it. Instead, it’ll give you a message that the folder is not empty:</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_c.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>This measure is in place to keep you from accidentally deleting the files you need. If you still need to delete the folder, use the <code class="text_code-inline">rm</code> command, like this:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>rm -r images # will delete the images folder from the current folder</p>
        </div>
        <p>In this case, we call <code class="text_code-inline">-r</code> a flag. We say, “We called the <code class="text_code-inline">rm</code> command with the <code class="text_code-inline">r</code> flag.” This flag is responsible for recursively deleting files and folders. That means that the directory’s entire contents will be deleted. Be careful: deleting files with the <code class="text_code-inline">rm</code> and <code class="text_code-inline">rmdir</code> commands is irreversible. The files don’t go to the recycle bin; they’re permanently deleted.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card_body">
        <div class="title-topic">Cheat Sheet Command Line</div>
        <div class="text_body">
          <p>We’ve prepared a cheat sheet for you. If you forget any commands, remember to come back to this lesson. We didn’t cover all of the commands on the list, so give them a quick run-through even if you remember the previous lesson well.</p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><code class="text_code-inline">pwd</code> shows you what folder you’re in</li>
              <li><code class="text_code-inline">ls</code> shows files in the folder you’re in</li>
              <li><code class="text_code-inline">cd first-project</code> go to the <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code> folder</li>
              <li><code class="text_code-inline">cd first-project/< html ></code> go to the html folder in the <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code> folder</li>
              <li><code class="text_code-inline">cd ..</code> go up one level to the parent folder</li>
              <li><code class="text_code-inline">cd ~</code> go to your home directory (that’s <code class="text_code-inline">/Users/students_yandex</code> in our case)</li>
              <li><code class="text_code-inline">rm about.html</code> deletes the <code class="text_code-inline">about.html</code> file</li>
              <li><code class="text_code-inline">rmdir images</code> deletes the <code class="text_code-inline">images</code> folder</li>
              <li><code class="text_code-inline">rm -r second-project</code> deletes the <code class="text_code-inline">second-project</code> folder and everything in it</li>
              <li>touch <code class="text_code-inline">index.htm style.css script.js</code> if several files need to be created, their names can be separated with spaces</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>To avoid having to enter file and folder names in full, you can start to enter their name and press the Tab key. The command prompt will finish writing the directory on its own if the corresponding file or folder is in the current directory.</p>
          <p>For example, if you’re in the <code class="text_code-inline">dev</code> folder, start typing <code class="text_code-inline">cd first</code> and press Tab. If the <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code> folder is inside <code class="text_code-inline">dev</code>, the command prompt will automatically complete its name. You’ll just need to press Enter.</p>

    <div class="card_body">
      <div class="title-topic">Configuring Git</div>
      <div class="text_body">
        <p>You’re now a command prompt Jedi. In this lesson, we’re going to use it to configure Git. You need to choose a name for yourself, just like in a computer game. This will help other developers understand what changes you made. Let’s do that and get things underway with Git.</p>
        <p><b>Configuration</b></p>
        <p>If you’re working on macOS or Linux, launch the Terminal. If you’re using Windows, launch Git Bash. Now input your name and email address. To do that, go to the command line and run the command <code class="text_code-inline">git config</code> with the option <code class="text_code-inline">--global</code>. Input your info as the values for <code class="text_code-inline">user.name</code> and <code class="text_code-inline">user.email</code>:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>git config --global user.name "Students Yandex"</p>
          <p><i># enter your first and last name or alias using Latin letters inside quotation marks</i></p>
          <p>git config --global user.email studentsyandex@gmail.com</p>
          <p><i># enter your real email address here</i></p>
        </div>
        <p>Now check to see what you get. Run the command git config with the option <code class="text_code-inline">--list</code>.</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>git config <i>--list</i></p>
          <p><i># use the command prompt to get the list of all config properties
          </i></p>
        </div>
        <p>In response, the command prompt will display your configurations:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>user.name=Students Yandex</p>
          <p>user.email=studentsyandex@gmail.com</p>
        </div>
        <p>Linux and macOS users will need to exit file view by pressing the Q key.</p>
        <p><b>Where configuration settings are stored
        </b></p>
        <p>If you need to view or change Git configuration settings, it doesn’t matter which command prompt directory you’re in. Calling git config <code class="text_code-inline">--global</code> will work from wherever you are.</p>
        <p>There it is! The first configuration settings are the most important because you can now fully use Git.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="card_body">
      <div class="title-course">Connecting Git to the Project</div>
      <div class="text_body">
        <p>We need to turn our project folder into a git repository, so that Git can start working with it. That means that Git will start tracking all changes made inside that directory. To do that, go to the folder containing the project and enter the command:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">git init</div>
        <p>The command prompt will reply with a message that the repository has been initialized.</p>
        <p>Make the <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code> folder a git repository. To do that, go to the <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code> folder using the <code class="text_code-inline">cd</code> command, and write <code class="text_code-inline">git init</code> in the command line.</p>
        <p>After that, run the <code class="text_code-inline">git status</code> command. Git will reply that this folder has two files, <code class="text_code-inline">index.html</code> and <code class="text_code-inline">style.css</code></p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_d.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>Git calls these files untracked files. That means that Git sees them, but it won’t be able to save their version right now if you try.</p>
        <p>That’s not what we want. Our goal is to learn how to save versions. To do that, add the files first. You’ll need the <code class="text_code-inline">git add</code> command for this. When using it, indicate the file name that we want to preserve in its current form. For example, <code class="text_code-inline">git add index.html</code>.</p>
        <p>If we want to save the current status of all files, we can jump to the option <code class="text_code-inline">--all</code>. <code class="text_code-inline">git add --all</code>, or <code class="text_code-inline">git add -A</code> for short:</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_e.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>Files highlighted in green are ready to be saved in their current versions. That’s what the <code class="text_code-inline">git add</code> command tells Git. But we haven’t saved them yet. We have to tell Git what we want to save before we actually save anything.</p>
        <p>In Git, saved file versions are called commits. Making a commit means saving the current state of your repository. We’ll tackle this in the next lesson.</p>
        <p>If we edit any file right now, it’ll turn red again:</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_f.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>Use <code class="text_code-inline">git add</code> to make the updated version go to the commit, like this:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>git add index.html</p>
        </div>
        <p>Or use the shortened version, <code class="text_code-inline">git add --all</code>:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>git add -all</p>
        </div>
        <p>This will add all modified files to be saved.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card_body">
        <div class="title-topic">Making the First Commit</div>
        <div class="text_body">
          <p>When all files are ready to be saved, we’ll make our first commit—that is, record the changes we’ve made so far. We do this using the command git commit with the option -m. -m is followed by the name of the commit in quotation marks:</p>
          <div class="text_code-box">
            <p>git commit -m "my first commit"</p>
          </div>
          <p>Press Enter and the current version of files will be saved with the name “my first commit.”</p>
          <p>“My first commit” isn’t the best name for a commit. Commits should be named so that anyone in the future can tell what changes were made. For example: “HTML and CSS for the home page,” “fixed bug,” “styles updated.”</p>
          <p>Make several commits by yourself in the first-project repository. The git log command will show the commit history:</p>
          <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_g.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
          <p>If it doesn’t work, make sure that you called <code class="text_code-inline">git add</code> and <code class="text_code-inline">git commit</code> in the right order. If it still doesn’t work, ask a question in Slack. In a real-life situation, though, you’d have to find the answers to a lot of questions on your own. We’ll let that be a small exercise.</p>
        </div>

    <div class="card_body">
      <div class="title-topic">Teamwork and GitHub</div>
      <div class="text_body">
        <p>We finished the last lesson by viewing the history of commits.</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_h.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>That means that we've saved our project several times, and we can jump back to them at any time. We’ll learn how to switch between different versions a little later. For now, let’s discuss Git’s second-biggest feature: making team coding convenient.</p>
        <p>Up to now, we’ve used Git locally. To share a repository, we’ll need to get the remote version. There are several platforms that let you do that. The most popular is GitHub, which is what we’ll use.</p>
        <p>You have to sign up with GitHub to start using it. This is what the next lesson is about.</p>
        <p>GitHub is also a social network for developers. Since its founding in 2008, GitHub, <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" target="_blank">according to its own statistics</a>, has connected tens of millions of people, given them the opportunity to make their dreams a reality, and let them freely exchange information.</p>
        <p>With GitHub, you can create an account, publish your code, and work jointly on any open source projects. You can also publish a website for free on <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a>.</p>
        <p>Lots of big companies—such as Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, and Valve—keep their projects on GitHub. It’s the perfect platform to hone your Git skills.</p>
        <p><b>Signing up</b></p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_i.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>This step is pretty easy. Enter your email address, username, and password. You’ll then be taken to the GitHub interface. Select "Choose Free" to open a free account. You’ll be asked several questions, such as what knowledge and skills you have and what your profession is. You can skip the survey. Just scroll to the end of the web page and click the "Complete Setup" button. You’ll just need to confirm your account. An email with a link to activate your account will have been sent to the email address you indicated. Clicking that link confirms your account.</p>
        <p><b>Summary</b></p>
        <p>You’re signed up now. That wasn’t so bad. You’re now at the screen to create your first remote repository. That’s what we’ll do in the next lesson.</p>

      <div class="title-topic">Linking the Local and Remote Repositoris</div>
      <div class="text_body">
        <p>We signed up on GitHub so we could upload our local repository, <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code> to GitHub's remote platform. To do that, we first need to create a repository on GitHub, then link the local repository to it. Let’s start by creating the repository on GitHub.</p>
        <p><b>Creating the repository on GitHub</b></p>
        <p>Go to your profile using the link <code class="text_code-inline"></code>https://github.com/your-username</p>. This displays what other users can see about you and your projects. You don’t have any projects yet. You can tell that from the message “You don’t have any public repositories yet”.</p>
        <p>Let’s create a repository. Click on Repositories:</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_j.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>Then click "New". GitHub’s interface is in English, so that’s a plus.</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_k.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>The window to create a new repository is now open. Name it <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code>. The remote repository’s name doesn’t have to be the same as the folder with the project on your computer. But just to make sure that we don’t get confused, let’s name them the same thing.</p>
        <p>After you write the name, click "Create Repository". We don’t need to worry about the other fields right now.</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_l.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>We’ve created the remote repository.</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_m.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p><b>Linking the local and remote repositories</b></p>
        <p>To link the remote repository to the local one, use the <code class="text_code-inline">git remote add</code> command. Assign two parameters to this command: the name of the remote repository and its URL. Like this (using your URL, not this one):</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>git remote add origin <i>https://github.com/YandexPracticum/first-project.git</i></p>
        </div>
        <p>The URL makes sense, but why is the name of the repository <code class="text_code-inline">origin</code> instead of <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code>? Things look a little confusing here. In this case, the repository’s name may not match its name in GitHub. But this is the name we’ll call the remote repository locally when we enter commands in the command prompt. We could assign it the name <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code>, but <code class="text_code-inline">origin</code> is the standard name for a remote repository. That will let us omit it from commands in the future. By default, Git will search for a remote repository with the name <code class="text_code-inline">origin</code>.</p>
        <p>The repositories are linked. Now we just need to upload the code to GitHub. The <code class="text_code-inline">git push</code> command does this. Call the command like this:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>git push -u origin master</p>
        </div>
        <p>The command prompt will ask you for your GitHub username. Input it and press Enter. Then type your GitHub password and press Enter.</p>
        <p>Windows users will sometimes need to enter their username and password in the pop-up window (you’ll be able to tell which one), not the command line.</p>
        <p>When you enter your password, the characters won’t appear on the screen, but that's just for security. The command line will still get your password once you type it in. If you enter your username and password correctly, the commits will move to GitHub.</p>
        <p>We’ll take a more in-depth look at the <code class="text_code-inline">git push</code> command in the next lesson. In the next sprint, we’ll learn what the word <code class="text_code-inline">master</code> means. For now, go to the remote repository on GitHub and refresh the web page.</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_n.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_o.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>The code has been uploaded (or pushed, as developers say). Now other developers can connect to this repository. You’ll soon find out how to do that. Now study the GitHub interface and the <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code> repository on it independently.</p>

      <div class="title-topic">Synchronizing the Local and Remote Repositories</div>
      <div class="text_body">
        <p>You’ve signed up, created a local repository, and pushed it to GitHub. The hard part is behind us. Nice job. Now we have to figure out how to get changes from the remote repository and push any changes we make to it. Let’s talk about that now.</p>
        <p><b>git push</b></p>
        <p>You’ve already gone through the commit cycle. You added a file using the <code class="text_code-inline">git add</code> command and committed it with a comment using <code class="text_code-inline">git commit</code>. After that, you linked your local repository to one you made on GitHub using a new command, <code class="text_code-inline">git push</code>, which you will use from now on to upload, or push, changes you make to your remote repo. This will allow your teammates to see and incorporate your work into their own.</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>git push -u origin master</p>
        </div>
        <p>We already used it in the previous lesson. We use this command to send new commits to GitHub. Now let’s practice how to do that.</p>
        <p>Add some simple markup to the <code class="text_code-inline">index.html</code> file. Add the files to the commit and make it. If you did everything right, the command prompt window after <code class="text_code-inline">git status</code> should look like this:</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_p.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>Now it’s time to incorporate the changes into your remote repository. Enter the <code class="text_code-inline">git push</code> command. The commit that you just made will move to the remote repository. If everything is correct, you’ll see this screen:</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_q.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>Move to the <code class="text_code-inline">first-project</code> repository in your GitHub account. You’ll see the modified files in the GitHub interface.</p>
        <p><b>git pull</b></p>
        <p>Right now, you’re working on the repository by yourself. But in real projects, you'll be working with others. Imagine you wrote code all day Friday, but decided to wait until Monday to push your commit. Now imagine your coworker worked on your project all weekend long, and by the time you come in on Monday, the repo on Github is very different from the one you have in your commit. What do you do? Use the <code class="text_code-inline">git pull</code> command to pull the changes your coworker made.</p>
        <p>Whenever you’re working on a repository with other people, always run <code class="text_code-inline">git pull</code> before you publish changes. Somebody else may have published changes while you were writing your part of the code.</p>

        <p>You can’t memorize all the commands at once. But the commit cycle is always the same. We’ve put together another cheat sheet in case you forget what comes after what.</p>
        <p><b>Commands for synchronizing your local repository with one on GitHub.</b></p>
        <p><code class="text_code-inline">git remote add origin https://github.com/YandexPracticum/first-project.git</code> — when we’re in the folder containing your local repository, this will link it to the remote repository (remember to enter your own URL).</p>
        <p><code class="text_code-inline">git push -u origin master</code> — push all files from the local repository to the remote one that you linked to it.</p>
        <p><b>Commands to commit the work you want to push.</b></p>
        <p><code class="text_code-inline">git add file_name</code> — add a single file by writing its name after add.</p>
        <p><code class="text_code-inline">git add -A</code> — to commit all files, use -A.</p>
        <p><code class="text_code-inline">git commit -m "comment on commit"</code> — make the commit. Leave a comment with the saved files to make it easier to understand which changes were made.</p>
        <p><b>Commands to push your commits.</b></p>
        <p><code class="text_code-inline">git pull</code> — pull changes made by other developers.</p>
        <p><code class="text_code-inline">git push</code> — publish changes to a remote repository.</p>

      <div class="title-topic">Cloning a Repository</div>
      <div class="text_body">
        <p>In previous lessons, you created a local repository and then linked it to a remote one. But sometimes, you’ll need to copy a ready-made repository to your computer. This process is referred to as cloning. We’ll cover that now.</p>
        <p><b>git clone</b></p>
        <p>Cloning a repository is usually the first thing a developer does in a new job. Let’s run through a scenario of this situation. Create a second repository in your account and call it <code class="text_code-inline">second-project</code>.</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_r.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>You’ll see the new repository screen. Copy its address, open the command line, and go to the folder where you’re going to save the repository (that's the <code class="text_code-inline">dev</code> folder, which you created in a previous lesson). You’re going to enter a command you haven’t seen before, <code class="text_code-inline">git clone</code>, and the repository address:</p>
        <div class="text_code-box">
          <p>git clone https://github.com/students-yandex/second-project.git</p>
          <p><i># don't copy this repository address; use your own</i></p>
        </div>
        <p>As soon as cloning has finished, go inside the repository using the <code class="text_code-inline">cd</code> command, create the files <code class="text_code-inline">index.html</code> and <code class="text_code-inline">style.css</code>, and make a commit. Open your GitHub account, select the second-project repository, and you’ll see the published commit:</p>
        <div><img src="../../images/3-6/3-6_s.png" class="image_flex-large"></div>
        <p>So now you have two ways of creating a repository at your disposal. But here’s one thing to be aware of: although you can clone absolutely any public repository, you can only push your code to repositories you've created yourself or have permission to push to. If you want to push your work to other repositories, you have to send a pull request.</p>
        <p><b>Summary</b></p>
        <p>You’ve learned the basic bash commands and how to work with Git. You learned how to push, pull, commit, and clone. You’ll need all these skills to submit your project and finish this sprint. But more importantly, these tools are indispensable for real-life jobs.</p>
