    <div class="subtitle">Lesson 3: Flex Containers with Multiple Items</div>
    <div class="parttitle">Part 1</div>
    <div>
      Let's create cover blocks for the projects you've already completed. For now, we're going to make placeholders for the first two projects. Create a flex container along with two flex items to go inside it.
      To do this:
      ol#Create a div block with a #flex-row# class.
      ol#Create two more div blocks inside this element. Each of the flex items should have the following two classes: #project# and #project_beginner#.
      Assign styles to the classes as follows:
      ul#For the #project# class, set up the background-position property so that it's centered both vertically and horizontally, and then add a background-size property and make it cover the entire block.
      ul#For the #project_beginner# class, set the #width# to 636px and the #height# to 430px.
    </div>
    <div class="parttitle">Part 2</div>
    <div>
      Let's give each block with the #project_beginner# class its own background. We need to create some more classes to do this.
      Add an extra class called #project_music-album# to the first block and another one called #project_design-principles# to the second.
      Set the styles for the additional classes as follows:
      ul#Add a background image to the #project_music-album# class with the address https://code.s3.yandex.net/web-code/album.png;
      ul#The address of the background image for the #project_design-principles# class is https://code.s3.yandex.net/web-code/design.png.
    </div>
    <div class="parttitle">Part 3</div>
    <div>
      Turn the element with the #flex-row# class into a flex container. Use the mouse to change the dimensions of the viewport. As the size of the element changes, the the images should expand and shrink to fill the entire flex container.
