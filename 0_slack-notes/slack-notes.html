            <p>I'm Maksim and I'm a web developer. I'm currently working for Yandex - the biggest russian IT company.</p>
            <p>During my liesure time I like to play board games (have a big collection of 'em). I'm also fond of sports  - used to do powerlifting and currently running almost every day.</p>
            <p>I'm very excited to start our education program and help you learn more about web development</p>

            <p>Hey, everyone!</p>
            <p>I see that many of you struggle to complete lessons on the platform. Here are a few tips that can help you complete the lessons with a breeze:</p>
            <p>
              <ol>
                <li>Always write just the required lines of code, and try not to touch anything besides that. If you do touch some unrelated code it might cause problems during lesson submission.</li>
                <li>If lesson consists of multiple parts, do not remove your code from one of the previous part.</li>
                <li>If you are prompted to write some text (not code, but human readable sentence), just copy and paste it - otherwise you might accidentally type the wrong character and platform won't accept your submission.</li>
                <li>Restarting the lesson can also help if you think your code is right - may be you've accidentally typed something and this might stop you from proceeding further</li>
                <li>If nothing else helped contact our @Поддержка / Learning Support app. They are available 24/7 and can help you resolve any technical issues with our platform</li>
              </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Hope this information will be helpful for you!</p>

              <p>@Maksim Kulichenko I'd have to disagree with your point number 3. I don't think it's good practice to copy and paste code. If we copy and paste the code, then we're not actually practicing those key strokes for the code. Maybe you should add to that point that it should ONLY be done as a last resort option. That's just my opinion.</p>

              <p>I'll clarify - I only meant using copy/paste for human sentences, not for code. During lessons you're sometimes asked, for example, to create a tag and write some text into it.  It's easy to make a mistake when you rewrite this text by hand, so I advised to copy it</p>

          <p>Hello my fellow students!</p>
          <p>Today I want to talk about bugs on our platform and in modern web technologies.</p>
          <p>When you complete the lessons on our platform you have very little chance of stumbling upon an actual technical problem. If something is not working - 99.9% chance that the problem is in your code. So, when you are studying - don't ever give up on a lesson because you think it's not in your power to complete it :muscle:. Reread the task, use the steps I've provided in this guide, and you'll be surely able to proceed!</p>
          <p>This also applies to the HTML and CSS - this technologies are very stable. Millions of sites use them and you can assume that they are flawless and have zero bugs. So if something is wrong - you can't position an element right or some CSS properties are not applied properly - it always means that there is a problem in your code. And it's in your power to fix it</p>
          <p>This statements might be obvious to the people familiar with web development :see_no_evil:, but I think they can also be helpful for those of you who are just starting out. Have a great day!</p>

          <p>Hi Team!</p>
          <p>In case anyone is struggling with the basics or hungry for more code outside of lessons-</p>
          <p>there is a website <a href="https://www.lynda.com/" target="_blank">lynda.com</a> full of videos and learning materials. You normally have to pay for a subscription to this site but many public libraries in the US will allow you free membership through your library card.</p>
          <p>I've noticed one of the things I struggle with is learning new information by reading text, so I've been supplementing lessons by watching videos on them here. Check it out! I think there's a free trial if interested.</p>
          <p>Keep up the good work</p>

          <p>morning! i found this pretty neat flexbox cheatsheet this morning, and figured I'd share. Not printer friendly though.</p>

          <p>Hey, Everyone!</p>
          <p>Understanding BEM can be difficult, I know that :upside_down_face: To help you with the first project I'll try to summarize it here in simple words:</p>
          <p>BEM is a methodology. It allows us to reuse styles and html, and avoid css class collisions (when you have 2+ classes with the same name in your project).</p>
          <p><b>Block</b> - is a basic entity. The classname for this entity should answer the question - "What is it?".</p>
          <p>Structure for a class name is - <code class="text_code-inline">{BLOCK_NAME}</code></p>
          <p>Examples classes are - <code class="text_code-inline">button</code>, <code class="text_code-inline">footer</code>, <code class="text_code-inline">gallery</code></p>
          <p><b>Element</b> - this entity should always be part of a block. The class name for this entity should answer the question - "What is it?". The same as for the block. The only difference is that elements are considered unusable without it's block. For example, you could have a <code class="text_code-inline">form</code> block, and it's elements - <code class="text_code-inline">form__input</code> and <code class="text_code-inline">form__button</code>. Those elements are only making sense when they are part of a form block. They can't be used without it.</p>
          <p><b>Modifier</b> - this entity can't be independent, it should always be used with a block or an element. The class name should answer the question - "How does it look?" (<code class="text_code-inline">button_theme_white, button_theme_black</code>) or "In what state is it?"(<code class="text_code-inline">button_disabled, button_focused</code>).</p>
          <p>Structure for a class name is -</p>
          <p><code class="text_code-inline">{BLOCK_NAME}__{ELEMENT_NAME}_{MODIFIER_KEY}_{MODIFIER_VALUE}
          </code>or <code class="text_code-inline">{BLOCK_NAME}__{ELEMENT_NAME}_{MODIFIER_STATE}</code> for elements;
            Example classes are: <code class="text_code-inline">button__icon_size_m </code>, <code class="text_code-inline">button__icon_hidden</code></p>
            <p><code class="text_code-inline">{BLOCK_NAME}__{MODIFIER_KEY}_{MODIFIER_VALUE</code> or <code class="text_code-inline">{BLOCK_NAME}_{MODIFIER_STATE}</code> for blocks; Example classes are: <code class="text_code-inline">button__size_m</code> , <code class="text_code-inline">button__hovered</code></p>
